			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>The project will showcase me as a competent developer with an adequate skill set and passion
				to be marketable.</p>

			<h2>Audience</h2>
			<p>The site is primarily designed to appeal to smaller and start up companies, rather than corporate.</p>

			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>To provide an additional feature on a portfolio or resume to increase my value as an employee, as well
				as to appeal to those looking for skilled workers to help them realize their passion.</p>

			<h2>Persona</h2>
			<p>Name: Shannon Digs</p>

			<p>Age: 26 years old</p>

			<p>Technical Expertise: Is confident in graphic design, as well as a competent mac OS 10 user,
				with a basic understanding of java and C++.</p>

			<p>Attitude: Very driven, has been burnt out by retail work. Shannon has begun work on
				their goal, and is looking to hire people with a similar drive. Disparages those who don't work hard,
				and values individuality. Shannon is not looking for someone who will simply work, but rather innovate.</p>

			<p>Description: After finishing their degree, worked in retail for some time. Didn't enjoy that work
				very much, unsurprisingly, and wants to expand their horizons. Has a hearing impaired cousin, and remembers how much
				difficulty they could sometimes have in interacting with certain websites. Shannon gets in touch with
				them, and starts to write up a plan for a program that could help make it easier in difficult circumstances.
				After a basic blueprint, began work on the program, but quickly realized that it would require more than
				just one person.</p>

			<p>Situation: Has been working for some time in retail, but recently began work on an idea to help
				the hearing impaired interact with websites that normally require audio cues. Shannon is now looking for passionate
				workers with relevant skill sets to help realize the project.</p>

			<p>Frustrations: Has little coding experience, and doesn't know the technical requirements necessary
				to make the project possible. Most others who share the same level of passion don't bring any relevant
				skills to the table, and just offered help in the planning phase. Shannon has begun moving out of the
				planning phase and into development, but needs to find people who know how to do that.</p>
