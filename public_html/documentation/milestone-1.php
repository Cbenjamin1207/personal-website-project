			<h2>Purpose</h2>
			<p>I seek to be working on an interesting project that I am passionate about, with people
				that hold ideals and passions compatible with mine. </p>

			<h2>Audience</h2>
			<p>Smaller and startup companies, along with potential customers looking for a freelance developer,
				as well as other freelance developers looking for partners.</p>

			<h2>Goal</h2>
			<p>To work or intern with a project with interesting implications and goals, or to survive until
				I reach that point.</p>

			<h2>Persona</h2>
			<p>Name: Shannon Digs</p>

			<p>Age: 26 years old</p>

			<p>Description: After finishing their degree, worked in retail for some time. Doesn't enjoy that work
				very much, unsurprisingly, and wants to expand. Has a hearing impaired cousin, and remembers how much
				difficulty they could sometimes have in interacting with certain websites. Shannon gets in touch with
				them, and starts to write up a plan for a program that could help make it easier in difficult circumstances.</p>

			<p>Situation: Has been working for some time in retail, but recently came up with an idea to help
				the hearing impaired interact with websites that normally require audio cues. Shannon is now looking for passionate
				workers with relevant skillsets to help realize the project.</p>

			<p>Difficulties: Has little to no coding experience, and doesn't know the technical requirements necessary
				to make the project possible. Most others who share the same level of passion don't bring any relevant
				skillsets to the table, and just want to help in the planning phase. Shannon is ready to move out of the
				planning phase and into development, but needs to find people who know how to do that.</p>
