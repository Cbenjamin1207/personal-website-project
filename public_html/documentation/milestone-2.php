			<h1>Calder Benjamin: Milestone 2</h1>
		</header>

		<main>
			<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
			<p>The overall strategy will be to showcase different projects of increasing difficulty,
				as each will build upon the last, thus making me immediately marketable to those who
				don't need any hard coding database design and just want a website, and then going
				further with each section.</p>

			<h3>Websites</h3>
			<p>The main content I will be posting is websites that I have completed, both professional and
				for personal enjoyment. This will be useful if I want to do freelance work, as a way to showcase
				my work.</p>

			<h3>Applications/Programs</h3>
			<p>This is to show any programs I have created, for more complicated purposes than just a basic
				website design and layout. I may include websites that have more complicated database design
				or javascript in here as well.</p>

			<h3>About Me</h3>
			<p>The final section will give a general overview of myself, some of my ideologies, and my
			general life story. I will also include links to other social media and contact sites.</p>
